# I´m a Full Stack Developer. I have studied in SoyHenry for 3 months and I have one more left. I´m searching for a position as a Full Stack Developer but also avaiable for a Front or Back position. I was born in Argentina but I also have my Italian citizenship. 
# I can speak Spanish, Italian or English. Right now I´m living in Argentina but I will be moving to Europe in a few months.
